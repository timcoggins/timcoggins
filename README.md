Hi, I'm Tim!

I'm a web developer, musician and audio engineer and am interested in building tools to help musicians.

I only recently returned to coding after many years of working in the music industry.

I'm a fast learner and love to explore new technologies. Currently, I'm working with Javascript, Typescript, HTML5, CSS3, React, NextJS, NestJS, Express, MySQL, PostGres, MongoDB, Firebase, Docker.
